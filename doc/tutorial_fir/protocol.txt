subjects fixated on a dot in the center of the screen, and viewed an
uninterrupted stream of scene images. on each trial, subjects were shown a photo
of a scene for 0.5s. subjects had 1.3s from the time the photo was shown to
indicate whether the scene was indoor or outdoor. the next trial began 0.2s
later, with the start of the next TR. subjects did this task in two separate
runs.

The task began after 6 volumes of disdaqs had been completed, and the TR was
1.5. There were 355 colledted volumes total in this scan.

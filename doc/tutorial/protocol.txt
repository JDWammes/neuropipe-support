18-35 year old subjects with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated
in an fMRI experiment to locate their FFA and PPA brain areas. they lay in a
Siemens Allegra 3T head-only scanner with a mirror on the head coil reflecting
projected stimuli. TR length was 1.5s. 6s of rest were allotted at the start of
the experiment, to allow the scanner signal to settle.

subjects fixated on a dot in the center of the screen, and viewed blocks of
either human faces or scenes. each block consisted of 12 trials. on each trial,
subjects were shown a face photo or scene photo, depending on the block type,
for 0.5s. subjects had 1.3s from the time the photo was shown to indicate
whether the photo was male or female--in face blocks, or indoor or outdoor--in
scene blocks. the next trial began 0.2s later, with the start of the next TR.

blocks alternated between scene and face types, starting with scene, and with
12s rest between blocks (SrFrSrF...).

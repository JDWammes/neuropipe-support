18-35 year old subjects with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated
in an fMRI experiment to locate their PPA brain area. they lay in a Skyra
Allegra 3T scanner with a mirror on the head coil reflecting projected stimuli.
TR length was 1.5s. 6s of rest were allotted at the start of the experiment, to
allow the scanner signal to settle.

subjects fixated on a dot in the center of the screen, and viewed blocks of
house images. each block consisted of 12 trials. on each trial, subjects were
shown a photo of a house for 0.5s. subjects had 1.3s from the time the photo
was shown to indicate whether the photo was a repeat of the photo immediately
preceeding it. the next trial began 0.2s later, with the start of the next TR.

blocks were separated by 12s rest between blocks (HrHrHr...).

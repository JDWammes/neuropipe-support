# run-order.txt describes the your fMRI scanning protocol
# original author: mason simon (mgsimon@princeton.edu)
# this script was provided by NeuroPipe. modify it to suit your needs
# 
#
# this file should contain 1 line per pulse sequence (run) in a scan session. on
# each line, put the name of the pulse sequence, optionally followed by a space
# and then the number of TRs collected in that sequence
#
# NeuroPipe will take your raw DICOM data and convert it to Gzipped NifTi files,
# named according to the pulse sequence names you give in this file. if you gave
# the number of TRs for a sequence, it will also check that the corresponding
# data file has that number of TRs, which can catch (rare) errors due to data
# mis-transferring from your scanner
#
# if you collected any runs of data that you don't care to analyze, put the text
# "ERROR_RUN", without quotes, at the start of the corresponding line. this is
# useful if you had to abort and restart a run for some reason
#
# lines beginning with a # are treated as comments, and NeuroPipe ignores them.
# if your run order deviated from the ideal for any of your subjects, write
# comments to remind yourself why
#
# GOTCHAS:
# - circle localizers transfer as 3 separate runs, so for each circle localizer
#   you ran, you must include 3 lines in this file 
# - fieldmaps transfer as 2 separate runs, so include 2 lines in this file for
#   each fieldmap you ran

# EXAMPLE RUN ORDER FOLLOWS. CUSTOMIZE THIS TO YOUR PROJECT

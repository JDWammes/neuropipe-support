README
  describes how to customize your project. start by reading this

PROTOCOL
  initially empty. describe your data collection procedure here

scaffold
  a command that sets up the 'scaffolding' for analyzing a new subject's data

scripts
  holds scripts that support your across-subject analyses

analysis
  holds intermediary files made by your across-subject analyses, such as those
  produced by FSL

results
  holds the results of your across-subject analyses, such as plots and tables
  of statistical test results

subjects
  holds a directory for each of the subjects run in your experiment. see the
  description of the subject-template dir for more details

subject-template
  holds the 'scaffolding' on which each subject's directory is based

subject-template/copy
  holds files and directories that must exist in all subjects' directories, but
  that may differ between subjects. see subdirectory descriptions below for more
  details
    all files and directories under this one will will be copied into the new
  subject's directory. any text files in this directory that contain the text
  <<SUBJ_ID>> will have that replaced by the subject's ID before they are copied
  into the subject's directory

subject-template/copy/data
  initially empty. provides a place for data to go when the subject is set up

subject-template/copy/results
  initially empty. provides a place for plots and statistical results to go when
  the subject is set up

subject-template/copy/scripts
  initially empty. provides a home for scripts that may need to be tweaked for
  each subject. see the README

subject-template/link
  holds files and directories that must exist in all subjects' directories, and
  that must be the same for all subjects, such as scripts that define your
  analysis at a high-level. all files under this directory will be linked in to
  the new subject's directory, which means that if they are changed in any
  subject's directory, the changes will simultaneously occur to those files in
  all other subject's directories

subject-template/link/README
  describes how to customize the subject's directory. read this after setting
  up a new subject

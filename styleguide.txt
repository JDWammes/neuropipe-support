documentation style
===================

- reStructuredText formatting is used
  (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html)
- the first letter in each sentence is not capitalized
- the last sentence in each paragraph has no final period. final ?'s and !'s are
  allowed
- text is wrapped to a new line at 80 characters


BASH script style
=================

every script, except for skeleton scripts provided for the user, must start with
the following header::

  #!/bin/bash
  #
  # ONE LINE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES
  # Copyright (C) 2010 AUTHOR NAME (AUTHOR EMAIL ADDRESS)

- variables that are set once and don't change (constants) are named in ALL_CAPS
- $var syntax is used wherever possible, because ${var} is ugly
- inside of if [] blocks, "$var" is used instead of $var
